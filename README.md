CurtainView
===========

The CurtainView is much like a layer on the top level of your layout. It's also a container which can wrap other Views.

And it will not block the actions of the child view unless you make a standard pull event.

The MotionEvent handling is base on chrisbanes' library : https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh.
